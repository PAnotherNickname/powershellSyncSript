SyncFolders
SyncFolders.ps1 is a simple PowerShell script that was created to synchronize the contents of two folders: a source and a replica folder. It maintains an identical copy of the source at the replica folder. The synchronization is one-way, meaning that the content of the replica folder is modified to exactly match the content of the source folder.
